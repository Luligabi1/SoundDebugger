# SoundDebugger

A small Minecraft Forge 1.8.9 client-side mod that logs any played SoundEvent's name and pitch.

## Why?

Ever heard a cool sound while on a server and thought "huh, that'd fit nicely on this personal project of mine", but couldn't remotely guess which sound is being used due to the distortion caused by the pitch? ...Probably not, but hey, if you do, you make sure to be glad you didn't have to setup ancient IntelliJ to make this, alright?! ðŸ¥²

The logging also works with [Replay Mod](https://www.replaymod.com/), so you don't need to have this at the moment you record the sound.
